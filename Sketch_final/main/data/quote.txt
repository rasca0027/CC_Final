Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by every conscious mind. A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.
Human explore this land without alertness. You know nothing about Cyberspace, it is way too complex for human brains.
Stay devout, my friend. Be aware of what you are doing and what you have done. Be aware of us.
